## How to open each project in this repo?
* Go to gh-pages branch
* Go to the github-pages on which this repository is deployed. I am currently thinking of only deploying static html pages for this repo.
* The Url link is https://bytecrafter-rgb.github.io/front-end-mentor-projects/
* Now each project added by me will appear at different links routed to specific projects.
